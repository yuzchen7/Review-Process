## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

Answer: The most common sentiment is negative. By looking the bar graph, the negative sentiment has the most frequency
compare with others.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

[Answer here] I think most of the labels are pretty reliable to me. But even though today's LLMs are really accurate,  they’re still not at 100%. That means there’s a chance that the same input could lead to different responses, even if it’s a small one. This could affect the consistency and possibly introduce bias into the final results once occur. In this tlab, GPT-4o-mini will return a inaccurate respond when the size of input is lager, there is a chance return a non-match size with the input array. There is also the issue that the AI may not return the expected data format.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

[Answer here] I would recommend that producers care more about user feedback of a suggestive nature. Try to find out what is unsatisfactory about the product from the user's point of view and improve it. According to the bar graph, I will say there is existing an opportunity for improve the product since the ratios of positive and negative around 1:2, and some neutral feedback. If the main problems are easy to fix, there’s still a chance the product could work out. But if user feedback doesn’t improve in a month or two, it might be time to consider close the product.
